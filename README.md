# Fatal Police Shootings in the U.S.: An Analytical Exploration

## Overview
This repository contains the Capstone Project for the first Sprint of the Data Analysis Module, focusing on a critical examination of fatal police shootings across the United States. Through this project, I aim to identify systemic issues within police actions against civilians, explore the impact of factors such as race, state policies, and mental health, and propose actionable solutions to address these concerns.

## Objectives
- To leverage data analysis in identifying underlying patterns and issues in police shootings.
- To perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dynamics and key factors involved.
- To utilize Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization.
- To draw insights that can help inform policy and operational changes within law enforcement agencies.

## Dataset
The primary dataset used in this project is the "Fatal Police Shootings in the U.S. '15 - '17". Additional datasets have been sourced to enrich the analysis. The datasets are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/washingtonpost/police-shootings).

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:** Implemented Pandas to clean data and engineered features to aid in the analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Utilized statistical measures and visualizations to uncover patterns within the data.
- **Insight Generation:** Focused on identifying key issues and proposing a prioritized plan for addressing them based on the analysis.

## Key Findings
- Summary of significant insights regarding state-wise disparities, racial biases, and the correlation between police funding and shooting incidents.
- Evidence of systemic issues suggested by data trends and statistical analysis.
- Recommendations for policy changes and areas requiring further investigation.

## Visualization Highlights
Includes a series of plots and charts that illustrate critical findings, such as:
- Geographic distribution of incidents.
- Correlation between race and shooting incidents.
- Analysis of mental health issues among victims.

## How to Navigate this Repository
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the detailed analysis, visualizations, and insights.
- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets used in this project.
